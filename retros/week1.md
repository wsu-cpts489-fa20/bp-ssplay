# Retrospective
* Week1: 
	* Goods:
		* The code progress is going well as we all try to implement features required. 
		* Code commits are being done consistently by everyone in the team.
		* Coding-wise, our team did a pretty good job.
	* Bads:
		* None of us paid much attention to the rubric so we were missing some key requirements which got us penalties on our grades.
        * Some of the User Story Gaols were not fully completed.
