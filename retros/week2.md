# Retrospective
* Week2: 
	* Completed:
		* Differentiate account type between "User" and "Operator"
		* Operator can add a Course with rates and tee time availability, on top of all functionalities that a User can do.
		* All users can book tee time. When choosing date and time if a slot is already booked, the UI will disable that timeslot. (Disable selection)
		* Updated the database to have actual information rather than random strings.
	* Struggles:
		* Figuring out how to set up the appointments schema for a course was quite a challenge, but once that was figured out, implementing the actual booking system posed lesser hardships.
		* Another small struggle was disabling the time slots, and getting a range of available dates for the Booking system.
		* Started deployment process but wasn't able to succesfully deploy.
