		* Reworked the logic of the Booking Tee Time
		* Deployed the website, fully functional
        		* Testing for the completed items
        		* Created Retrospective folder with week1-week4 retros
	* Struggles:
		* Figuring out how to do the booking tee time properly was a pain
		* Deployment was also a struggling as the environment won't recognize the variables
		* Doing the API for Nearby Courses was also hard, most examples are in HTML/CSS so I had to rework it into React 
	* Needs Improvement:
		* Team communication and participation
        		* Distribute work properly
