# ssplay-app features	
* a UI for speedgolfers who want to browse courses, rate courses, review courses, and book/pay for tee times;
* a UI for course operators who want to set speedgolf rates, specify available tee times, and receive payments for speedgolf reservations
* a UI is needed to allow users to specify the details of a given course: hole yardages, running distances, time pars, stroke pars. These details could be specified by speedgolfers familiar with the course, or by course operators.

# Retrospective
* Week1: 
	* Goods:
		* The code progress is going well as we all try to implement features required. 
		* Code commits are being done consistently by everyone in the team.
		* Coding-wise, our team did a pretty good job.
	
	* Bads:
		* None of us paid much attention to the rubric so we were missing some key requirements which got us penalties on our grades.
